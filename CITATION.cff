  This digital puzzle offers a twelve-part interactive
  exploration of the history of Jewish life in Basel between
  1850 and 1914. Users unlock individual puzzle pieces by
  engaging with historical content and solving corresponding
  questions. A correct answer reveals the reverse of the
  piece and grants access to the next stage. As a final
  reward, successful participants receive a free museum
  entry. The game is designed to foster curiosity and
  engagement, while also stimulating cognitive functions
  such as concentration and short-term memory. By blending
  play with learning, the application encourages users to
  deepen their understanding of Jewish history in Basel
  through active participation.
